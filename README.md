# Lua Snake

*Author: [Kyle Beasley](https://www.github.com/krbeasley)*

Lua Snake is a super simple 2D 'Snake Game' written in (you guessed it) Lua! Lua Snake also takes advantage of the Love2D game framework. I created this project in order to get more comfortable working with the Lua language as well as try my hand at making some of the foundational video games.
